# Mappping-Gene-Network-

The aim of the project is to find the correlation between different genes by using the cancer dataset. Cancer affects different parts of the body in different ways, the TCGA database gives us an information about how each gene is expressed in different cancer we compare this information with GTEX database which gives us information about the normal counter parts of the cancer affected areas. Each gene in a particular tissue is either up regulated or down regulated when it gets affected by the particular cancer, this change in gene expression is called the fold change value. We will be using this fold change value to construct a covariance matrix of all the genes that are present for a particular cancer and then assign a correlation score to each gene correlation pair which will ultimately be binned to a particular level according to the correlation score assigned.Each level will represent a gene network which will have all the correlated genes.
